# Summary

### Part I 1Ô∏è‚É£

My project started relatively broad with the topic initially being 'How Working Remote Affected Productivity'. I started with creating a story about how when the pandemic began, people's work styles shifted as they moved to remote and hybrid models. I discussed how remote work first increased productivity by reducing commuting time and providing flexibility, but it eventually revealed issues including burnout, a lack of work-life boundaries, and decreased collaboration.

**These are the steps I started with for Part I:**

* Next, I worked on a Reader's objective to understand how this topic affected both managers and employees and what they can do to maintain productivity in the workplace.

* I also created a story arc for my project and brainstormed about how I wanted the story to flow and its call to action.

* Next, I started working on some initial sketches and infographics to help narrate my story. I divided up these sketched in 3 parts: setup, conflict, and resolution to build my story.

* I identified the tools I would use to create various story elements, such as Shorthand for presenting, Tableau for visualizations, and Canva for creating custom infographics to support the story.

* I wrapped up the first part by specifying call-to-action items (here, it was suggestions for companies/managers and people to increase productivity in hybrid or entirely remote work settings). The in-class feedback definitely helped with polishing up the story line and visualizations.

### Part II 2Ô∏è‚É£

Based on in-class feedback, I narrowed down the narrative and story for the project. Now, I created an idea on 'The Hybrid Work Solution: Balancing Career Growth and Productivity for Early-Career Professionals'. This basically shifted the focus to trade-offs of remote and hybrid work arrangements, with recommendations for early-career professionals. It talks about how diverse work paradigms affect productivity and career success.

For this part, I wanted to create personas (Manager and Graduate Student) to help me refine my storyline. 

**Changes I made concerning the Audience üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

* I started with having two generic examples- a manager and an employee who wanted to achieve the optimal amount of productivity.
* However, after the in-class feedback, these personas very refined and made more specific.
* I created 2 personas using Canva where I put together their demographic information, pain points, and goals.
* Finally the reader's objective also changed to this: ' As a manager or early-career employee, I want to understand how different work models, affect career development and productivity. I seek practical insights on how to stay productive, engaged, and facilitate career growth in these work environments.'
* This was a pivotal shift in my story arc and call to action.

**Some Other Changes:**
* I also created more visualizations in Tableau and high-fidelity wireframes/infographics for my new story.

* The user review protocol where I identified interviewees and created a script (questions) was pretty helpful as I got detailed feedback from 3 people who matched my actual personas. I interviewed 2 graduate students and 1 manager. This helped me figure out what changes I needed to implement and refine my visualizations.

* Next, I started by laying out the initial storyboard draft in Shorthand.

* The second round of in-class peer feedback helped identify several key takeaways I planned to accommodate in Part III to help the audience understand the story better.

### Part III 3Ô∏è‚É£

For this final deliverable, I focused on feedback provided by the professor, classmates, and my user reviews. 
<br>
**The changes I made were centered around the following:**

* Finalizing what specific visualizations/infographics I wanted to highlight during my presentation.

* Modifying the Tableau visuals to match the Shorthand format.

* Changing the story's arrangement to make the flow seem more logical.

* Re-aligning and adding chart components to improve readability.

* Removing unnecessary infographics that did not communicate anything extra.


**Adding a final call to action based on new information:**

* **Adopt Hybrid Work:** Encourage managers to implement hybrid work models that balance flexibility with structured in-office collaboration to boost engagement and productivity.
* **Foster Team Connections:** Promote regular in-person or virtual team interactions to strengthen workplace relationships, reducing isolation and burnout in hybrid settings.
* **Leverage Flexibility for Productivity:** As an employee, use the flexibility of hybrid work to design a schedule that maximizes your productivity, balancing focused remote work with in-person networking.
* **Focus on Career Development:** Use hybrid work to your advantage by seeking development opportunities, ensuring continuous career growth in a flexible work model.

## Final Data Story üìñ

#### Link - [Data Story (Shorthand)](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-hybrid-work-solution/index.html#article)

Title - The Hybrid Work Solution: Balancing Career Growth and Productivity for Early-Career Professionals

This story is based on [Final Project Part 1](https://saylibhavsar.github.io/Data-Visualization-Projects/final-project-part-one.html) & [Final Project Part 2](https://saylibhavsar.github.io/Data-Visualization-Projects/final-project-part-two.html).

#### Design Decisions üé®

In terms of the design, I wanted to keep it relatively straightforward and maintain the story-arc flow (Setup, Conflict, and Resolution). For this reason, I chose a timeline structure in Shorthand. I synced the visualizations and graphics to the timeline sections:
1. Rise of Covid
2. The Difficulties
3. Rise of Hybrid Work

In the data story, I also included a quick introduction and personas to help explain who the Target Audience was. Finally, I ended with a Call-To-Action for both my persona types.
