**## About me**
I have a background focused in data analytics, consulting, and project management, with hands-on experience in tools like Alteryx and Smartsheet. Recently during my internship at KPMG, I focused on automating processes and solving data challenges, particularly in bank reconciliation projects. Currently, as a graduate student at CMU, I'm expanding my expertise in data storytelling to enhance my ability to communicate insights and drive impactful decisions.
